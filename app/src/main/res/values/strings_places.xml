    <string name="pyramids_title">pyramids of Giza</string>
    <string name="pyramids_description">The last surviving of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World,
        the Pyramids of Giza are one of the world\'s most recognizable landmarks.
        Built as tombs for the mighty Pharaohs and guarded by the enigmatic Sphinx,
        Giza\'s pyramid complex has awed travelers down through the ages and had archaeologists
        (and a fair few conspiracy theorists) scratching their heads over how they were built for centuries.
        Today, these megalithic memorials to dead kings are still as wondrous a sight as they ever were.
        An undeniable highlight of any Egypt trip, Giza\'s pyramids should not be missed.</string>
    <string name="nile_cruising_title">Nile Cruising</string>
    <string name="nile_cruising_description">Egypt is defined by the Nile.
        For many visitors a multi-day cruise upon this famed waterway that saw the rise of the Pharaonic era is a highlight of their Egypt trip.
        Cruising the Nile is also the most relaxing way to see the temples that stud the banks of the river on the route between Luxor and Aswan,
        plus sunrise and sunset over the date-palm-studded river banks, backed by sand dunes, is one of Egypt\'s most tranquil vistas.
        The two famous sights on a Nile Cruise are the Temple of Kom Ombo and Edfu\'s Temple of Horus,
        where all the big cruise boats stop. If you\'d prefer a less crowded and slower experience though,
        and don\'t mind "roughing it" a bit, you can also cruise the Nile by felucca (Egypt\'s traditional lateen-sailed wooden boats),
        which also allows you to create your own itinerary. Cruise boats depart from both Luxor and Aswan,
        but feluccas can only be chartered for multi-day trips from Aswan.

    <string name="alexandria_title">Alexandria</string>
    <string name="alexandria_description">The most European of Egypt\'s cities,
        Alexandria has a history that not many others can match. Founded by Alexander the Great,
        home of Cleopatra, and razzmatazz renegade city of the Mediterranean for much of its life,
        this seaside city has an appealing days-gone-by atmosphere that can\'t be beaten. Although today,
        there are few historic remnants of its illustrious past — feted in songs and books —
        this is a place made for aimless strolling along the seashore Corniche,café-hopping, and souk shopping.</string>
    <string name="aswan_title">Aswan</string>
    <string name="aswan_description">Egypt\'s most tranquil town is Aswan, set upon the winding curves of the Nile.
        Backed by orange-hued dunes, this is the perfect place to stop and unwind for a few days and soak up the chilled-out atmosphere.
        Take the river ferry across to Elephantine Island and stroll the colorful streets of the Nubian villages.
        Ride a camel to the desert monastery of St. Simeon on the East Bank.
        Or just drink endless cups of tea on one of the riverboat restaurants,
        while watching the lateen-sailed feluccas drift past.
        There are plenty of historic sites here and numerous temples nearby,
        but one of Aswan\'s most popular things to do is simply kicking back and watching the river life go by.</string>
    <string name="louxor_karnak_temple_title">Louxor Karnak Temple</string>
    <string name="louxor_karnak_temple_description">EFamed for the Valley of the Kings,
        Karnak Temple, and the Memorial Temple of Hatshepsut,
        the Nile-side town of Luxor in Upper Egypt has a glut of tourist attractions.
        This is ancient Thebes, power base of the New Kingdom pharaohs,
        and home to more sights than most can see on one visit.
        While the East Bank brims with vibrant souk action,
        the quieter West Bank is home to a bundle of tombs and temples that has been called the biggest open-air museum in the world.
        Spend a few days here exploring the colorful wall art of the tombs and gazing in awe at the colossal columns in the temples,
        and you\'ll see why Luxor continues to fascinate historians and archaeologists.</string>
    <string name="sinai_st_Catherin_title">Sinai-St-Catherin\'s Monastery</string>
    <string name="sinai_st_Catherin_description">One of the oldest monasteries in the world, St. Catherine\'s stands at the foot of Mount Sinai,
        where Moses is said to have received the Ten Commandments. This desert monastery is home to an incredible collection of religious iconography, art,
        and manuscripts (some of which can be seen in the on-site museum), as well as the burning bush.
        For most visitors here, a trip to St. Catherine\'s also involves a hike up Mount Sinai to see sunrise or sunset.
        Take the camel path for the easy route or climb the famous Steps of Repentance if you want better views</string>
    <string name="thistlegorm_dive_site_title">ThisTlegorm Dive Site</string>
    <string name="thistlegorm_dive_site_description">Below the Red Sea\'s surface is another world as fascinating as the temples and tombs on land.
        Among the many coral reefs off the coast there\'s also a glut of shipwrecks that have sunk in the Red Sea\'s Gulf of Gubal and Gulf of Aqaba.
        Of all the wrecks, the most famous is the Thistlegorm,
        an English WWII cargo ship that was on its way to resupply British troops when it was bombed by the Germans in 1941.
        Today the site is regarded by divers as one of the top five wreck dives in the world due to the vast cargo of cars,
        motorbikes, and WWII memorabilia that can be seen both scattered on the sea bed around the wreck and inside the ship itself.
        Dive boat trips to the wreck are organized from both Sharm el-Sheikh and Hurghada.</string>
